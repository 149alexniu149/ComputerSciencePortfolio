A functioning model of a piston powered by combusion of fuels. When two particles of different 
colors collide, they combine and release energy, speeding up every other particle in the system.
Most of the code in this was written by a partner and I however some was provided to us by Dr. Black including ball, timerhandler, and
parts of vector definitions. Additionally, other than the construction of the walls and the combining of particles, all graphical programming was done by Dr. Black

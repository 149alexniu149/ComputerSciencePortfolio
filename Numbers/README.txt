		=========================================
	Numbers is a fast-paced, strategy-oriented, game of wits, skill, and luck. 
Your goal is to become the master of the board and defeat the dreaded overlord,
Kompootar. 

To play you must touch cards matching the center of the deck in either number or color. If there are no matches, you must
draw a card. The game is won when your hand is completely empty.

The computer will try to prevent you from winning by placing it's own matches on the center card. Defeat him and win 
eternal glory.


Android 5.0 required to play this game.
